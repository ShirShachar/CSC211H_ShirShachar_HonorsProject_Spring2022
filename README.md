# Inspiration for TheRumorApp 

It all started in Ideathon we has during my CSC211H course this spring. In this project, I choose to focus on 5g misinformation and conspiracy. Link to my website https://sites.google.com/view/csc211hshirshacharhonorsprojec/home

All around the world, around the 1970s, following the Cold War, many rumors started to circle that electric products such as televisions, microwaves, ovens and cellphones are and will become a possible human health catastrophe. That was the beginning of the 2g era. 

There are serious debates about the dangers of 5G technology on human life. The conspirecy started after the coronavirus was first announced in Wuhan, China in 2019. 5G was launched first in China. At this time, the first patient of coronavirus was reported. Many people died. The fact that both cases happened at the same time helped create rumors about the 5G tech. In a time of crisis conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus

# My solution

My solution is to build an IOS application using the QT environment -- which will display information and lead the user to a website that gives more information about 5G misinformation. The information will be taken from known and proven sources like doctors, people that have studied the spoken areas for years and we can listen to them. Therefore, people will be able to distinguish between bad and accurate information,while also being able to stop the spread of rumors.

In our app, you can also play a game to determine if a rumor is True or False, and learn how to distinguish between real and false information. 

# How to use the App
* Download and install QT

At first, you would have to download QT Framework from their website: https://bit.ly/3MXbKiS. Follow the instructions to install version 6.3. 

****need to put here the instraction about using my application***

# Challenges
* My greatest challenge was learning how to use the QT environment since the syntax in QT is slightly different from what I've learned in C++ so far. To overcome this challenge, I used the help I was provided by Professor Azhar and the mentors working under him. In addition, I watched YouTube videos that guide me through it.

* In my application, you start with a login window and once you enter your values it's directing you to the main menu. There you have three options - About the rumor app, 5g information, and the rumor game. The most challenging was the rumor game, where the user needed to enter answers to questions of True or False. then I need to define if the input is correct and show back the answer to the user so he'll know how many points he achieved.

# Accomplishments
* Successfully incorporated all major advanced programming techniques learnt in my 211H class.
* Learnt QT framework and QT API
* Adherence to the project schedule

# Future direction
* I want to allow the user swipe/choose each question in a diffrent window.
* I want to have a search box so the user can search for article in real time.
