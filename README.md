# Inspiration for TheRumorApp 

All around the world, around the 1970s, following the Cold War, many rumors started to circle that electric products such as televisions, microwaves, ovens and cellphones are and will become a possible human health catastrophe. That was the beginning of the 2g era. 

There are serious debates about the dangers of 5G technology on human life. The conspirecy started after the coronavirus was first announced in Wuhan, China in 2019. 5G was launched first in China. At this time, the first patient of coronavirus was reported. Many people died. The fact that both cases happened at the same time helped create rumors about the 5G tech. In a time of crisis conspiracy theories can spread as fast as a virus

# My solution

My solution is to build an IOS application using the QT environment -- which will display information and lead the user to a website that gives more information about 5G misinformation. The information will be taken from known and proven sources like doctors, people that have studied the spoken areas for years and we can listen to them. Therefore, people will be able to distinguish between bad and accurate information,while also being able to stop the spread of rumors.

In our app, you can also play a game to determine if a rumor is True or False, and learn how to distinguish between real and false information. 

# How to use the App
* Download and install QT

At first, you would have to download QT Framework from their website: https://bit.ly/3MXbKiS. Follow the instructions to install version 6.3, and XCODE version 13 - https://developer.apple.com/xcode/.
